With `MDXRenderer` you can use the `<YouTube />` component which is part of the theme.

Just give it an `id` of a YouTube video and you're all set.

```js
<YouTube id="WFOxZAmB_1Y" />
```

<YouTube id="WFOxZAmB_1Y" />
<br />
<br />

With `MDXRenderer` you can use the `<Tweet />` component which is part of the theme.

Just give it an `id` of a Tweet and you're all set.

```js
<Tweet id="1208145049843683328" />
```

<Tweet id="1208145049843683328" />
