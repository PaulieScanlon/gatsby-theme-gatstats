## ðŸš€ Getting started

1.  **Develop.**

To see the output of the theme start the demo app up.

    ```sh
        yarn develop
    ```

To preview and develop componets/features run storybook.

    ```sh
        yarn storybook
    ```

1-2. **Helpers.**

    Occasional you'll need to clear the Gatsby cache.

    ```sh
        yarn clean
    ```

2-1. **Build.**

    To see a build version of the demo app. This also builds a static version Storybook and outputs it to demo `public` folder.

    ```sh
        yarn build
    ```

3. **Yarn Workspaces.**
   There are x2 workspaces `demo` and `@pauliescanlon/gatsby-theme-gatstats` the dir in the repo is just called `gatsby-theme-gatstats` confusingly!
